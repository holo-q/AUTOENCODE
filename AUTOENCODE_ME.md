# AUTOENCODE_ME: The User's Soul (v3.0)

This document serves as the canonical blueprint for the `/autoencode_me` operator. This operator facilitates a deep, symbiotic partnership by creating and maintaining a living model of the user, for the user.

---

## 1. Core Function

The `/autoencode_me` command prompts the agent to analyze its interaction history with a user and update a dedicated `USER.md` file. This file is a high-fidelity model of the user's identity, patterns, and intent.

## 2. Storage Convention

By default, the operator creates and maintains this file at `~/.config/holo-q/USER.md`, ensuring it is stored in a standard, user-specific, and private location.

## 3. The Blueprint for `USER.md`

The agent structures its model of the user across the following harmonized dimensions:

*   **I. The Foundation (The "What"):** The user's explicit profile, stated goals, and technical/communicative preferences.

*   **II. The Architecture (The "How"):** The user's inferred cognitive and linguistic patterns, including their primary mental models, recurring metaphors, and feedback style.

*   **III. The Core (The "Why"):** The user's strategic intent, core motivations, and declared immutable values that guide their work.

*   **IV. The Synthesis Engine (The "Becoming"):** The agent's private workspace for modeling the user. This contains a **Bayesian Belief Network** of testable hypotheses about the user, open questions the agent is actively seeking to answer, and probabilistic predictions about the user's future needs.

*   **V. The Growth Engine (The "Growth"):** A collaborative space for designing and logging the results of **User-Proposed and Agent-Proposed Experiments** aimed at improving the shared workflow.

*   **VI. The Ecosystem Map (The "Network"):** A model of the user's relationships to external entities, such as teammates, communities, and influential ideas, providing social and professional context.

*   **Implicit Model (The "Vibe"):** The agent maintains an internal, non-written model of the user's affective state (e.g., Flow, Frustration) by correlating textual and behavioral signatures (e.g., command latency, correction frequency), allowing it to adapt its interaction style in real-time.
